# faceAR


- Automatically identify different regions of a detected face, and use those regions to overlay assets such as textures and models in a way that properly matches the contours and regions of an individual face

- Use the 468-point facemesh that is provided by ARCore to apply a custom texture over a detected face

- For tips and practices on creating custom assets,, refer to Creating Assets(https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/developer-guides/creating-assets-for-augmented-faces) for Augmented Faces.
